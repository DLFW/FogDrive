Welcome to FogDrive
===================

The FogDrive project aims to provide free and open source electronics for vaping devices, the so called “mods”.
This includes the circuit specifications, parts lists, proposals on how to build the actual board
and – last but not least – the firmware for the micro-controller which is part of the circuit.

FogDrive is a free and open project, published under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/), version 3. We have no commercial interests and provide only information on how to build the electronics on your own.

FogDrive is under very early development. Mira is the first simple FogDrive that just switches the vaporizer on and off via a MOSFET.
The vaporizer is driven directly by the battery. In addition, Mira supports a few tiny comfort
features like battery voltage supervision. The next circuit is in an early planning phase.

Mira is currently in beta status and we are working on an online documentation and the host the the FogDrive builts.

For all of those out there who are interested to participate in the development: you are very welcome! Especially people who can contribute to the design of the voltage converters and electronic geeks in general could fill a significant gap. :) If you’re interested, please mail to `fogdrive {ät} llin -fullstop- info` or leave a message on the GitHub wiki.
