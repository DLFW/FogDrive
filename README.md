Welcome to FogDrive
===================

FogDrive is project that aims to provide free and open source electronics for controling vaping devices.
This includes – or will include – the circuit specifications, parts lists, proposals on how to build the actual board
and – last but not least – the firmware for the microcontroller which is part of the circuit.

FogDrive is a free and open project, published under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/), version 3. We have no commercial interests and will not sell anything.

FogDrive is under early development. Currently, it cannot provide anything which would be directly usabel. If you’re interested in building your own mod by the help of such a project, check back in a couple weeks or a few months.

As of now, we have a few rought milestones in mind:

1. Creating a first circuit only passing the battery voltage unregulated, providing battery supervision and switching the device on and off
2. Providing ready-to-use builds of the project
3. Creating a second circuit providing a measurement of the vaporizers resistance
4. Realizing a voltage regulation (maybe first a step down, later on also a boost conversion)

At least the last point is kind of a long-term goal.
Of course, there will be some important in-between steps and other valuable features. But currently, there is no point for detailed planning, the next steps are clear and the vision is present. And as long as this is mostly a one-man show, the future of the project is always in danger. That brings us to the next point:

For all of those out there that are interested to participate in the development: you are very welcome! Especially people who can contribute to the design of the voltage converters and electronic geeks in general could fill a significant gap. :) If you’re intrested, please mail to `fogdrive {ät} gmx.de` or – if you can stand the German language – get in contact via this [discussion at Dampfertreff](http://www.dampfertreff.de/t151555f130-freie-und-quelloffene-Regelelektronik-Unterstuetzung-gesucht.html) (even the response might be more delayed).

The very first control of the FogDrive project might probably be a simple MOSFET switch circuit, enhanced by a battery voltage measurement with a LED indicator and a multi-click on/off-switch. It might get enhanced then by a coil resistance measurement, a display and maybe some small fancy features.
