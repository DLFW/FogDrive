Welcome to FogDrive
===================

FogDrive is a young project that aims to provide free and open source electronics for controlling vaping devices.
This will include the circuit specifications, parts lists, proposals on how to build the actual board
and – last but not least – the firmware for the microcontroller which is part of the circuit.

FogDrive is a free and open project, published under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/), version 3. We have no commercial interests and provide only information on how to build the electronics on your own.

FogDrive is under very early development. Currently, it does not provide anything which is directly usable. If you’re interested in building your own mod by the help of FogDrive, check back in a couple weeks or a few months.

As of now, we have a few rough milestones in mind:

1. Creating a first circuit which simply switches the battery voltage via a MOSFET. The voltage will not be regulated. The circuit shall provide a battery supervision (voltage measurement) and the ability to be switched on and off.
2. Providing ready-to-use builds of the project and a documentation that is available online.
3. Creating a second circuit providing a measurement of the vaporizers resistance.
4. Realizing a voltage regulation (maybe first a step down, later on also a boost conversion)

At least the last point is kind of a long-term goal. As long as this is mostly a one-man show, the future of the project is always in danger. That brings us to the next point:

For all of those out there who are interested to participate in the development: you are very welcome! Especially people who can contribute to the design of the voltage converters and electronic geeks in general could fill a significant gap. :) If you’re interested, please mail to `fogdrive {ät} llin -fullstop- info` or – if you can stand the German language – get in contact via this [discussion at Dampfertreff](http://www.dampfertreff.de/t151555f130-freie-und-quelloffene-Regelelektronik-Unterstuetzung-gesucht.html) (even the response might be more delayed).
