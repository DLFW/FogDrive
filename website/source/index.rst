Welcome to FogDrive
===================

FogDrive is new project that aims to provide free and open source electronics for vaping devices. This includes the circuit specification, parts lists, proposals on how to build the actual board and – last but not least – the firmware for the microcontroller which is part of the circuit.

As of now, this project is under very early development abd cannot provide any usable stuff. For all of those out there that are interested to participate in the development: you are very welcome! Especially people who can contribute to the design of the converter parts are missing. If you’re intrested, please mail to `fogdrive {ät} gmx.de` or – if you can stand the German language – join the `discussion at Dampfertreff <http://www.dampfertreff.de/t151555f130-freie-und-quelloffene-Regelelektronik-Unterstuetzung-gesucht.html>`_.

The very first control of the FogDrive project might probably be a simple MOSFET switch circuit, enhanced by a battery voltage measurement with a LED indicator and a multi-click on/off-switch. It might get enhanced then by a coil resistance measurement, a display and maybe some small fancy features.

The long-term goal of the project is a control that does proper power regulation and can be configures for different user interfaces. As said before, the project lacks currently of electronics know how and would appreciate any help especially on the power regulation.
